I graduated biology and started to master of bioinformatics from Turkey. I had to quit bioinformatics master when I was on my thesis process. Because we moved in Newyork. I could not find a related job with my major which is biology. Because I have not much experience and I have some language difficulties. My husband also could not find a good job when we first come USA. I started to working part time jobs but then, I realized have to improve myself and find a job. After that I started to searching course online. I found Coursera and took my first certification of 'What is Data Science' successfully. After take the first course, I found motivation to continue other courses. I want to become a data scientist eventually. I am planning to finished all IBM Data Science certification courses. I believe that my biology background and this IBM certification will make me more qualified employer for bioinformatics data area.
